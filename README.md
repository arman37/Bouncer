# Bouncer
Bouncer
==================================
This is a simple JavaScript application developed with core JavaScript without using any external JS library.
I have developed this little application totally for fun.
But in this tiny application i have tried to demonstrate how JS developers can implement OOP, Prototypal Inheritance, Static variable & method, Event Bindings, Callbacks, IIFE(immediately-invoked function expression), Method chaining, factory design pattern, Mathematics etc in their JavaScript application.

HOW TO RUN
========
1. Clone the project from git.
2. Go to 'Bouncer' directory & open 'index.html' file in your browser.
